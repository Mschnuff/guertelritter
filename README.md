# About this repository:
With this project I test the capabilities of the **ebiten** game engine while also practicing working with golang at the same time by building a game prototype. The game is themed around an astronaut flying through space. The astronaut is also supposed to encounter asteroids on which he can land and thus switch to a different mode of movement.
