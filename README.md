# About this repository:
With this project I test the capabilities of the **ebiten** game engine while also practicing working with golang at the same time by building a game prototype. The game is themed around an astronaut flying through space. The astronaut is also supposed to encounter asteroids on which he can land and thus switch to a different mode of movement.

## next Steps (TODO):
- [X] make player object rotate towards the mouse Cursor
- [X] draw arrow on player object to make it obvious what it is facing atm
- [ ] refactor the main file to generalise the functionality so it can be used of other objects (besides player-object)
- [X] figure out how embed other go files (in the same directory and in other directories)
- [ ] add keyboard input for moving the player-object
